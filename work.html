            <b>Skills</b> <br> <br>
             <p>I sometimes make a living out of these programming languages that I know but I don't know if these thing will be called 'SKILLS' haha anyways, there are students who would actually come to me and ask me to make their machine problems or assignments. So I hope you enjoy.</p>

                <b>C++ - </b> I already have deleted all of my c++ programs because I restarted my laptop except for this one because this is the very recent CUI program that I made. I think this was their final project.

                <b>Word Press - </b> Me and my group made this project for our Fundamentals of Computer Networks project which we are really proud of because as what the lower years said that our professor put it as an example in their class. but unfortunately, I cannot retrieve the file now.
